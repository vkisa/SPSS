Football Match Stats Factor Analysis 

This project was written in Turkish since it coincided with the beginning of the period in which I developed my English.

I aimed to guess the variables needed to estimate the most valuable player or, in other words  the man of the match in the SPSS program 
by Factor Analysis model  in this study.
